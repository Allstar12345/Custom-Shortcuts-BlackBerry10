Custom Shortcuts is handy App that allows you to create Homescreen Shortcuts on your BlackBerry 10 device


Please note the code here is very old and was never cleaned up in time for the closure of BlackBerry World to developers.

Another note:
This code is for v1.40, unfortunately we have lost the code for the final v1.41 release
